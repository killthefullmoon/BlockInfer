To
 find
 the
 expression
 for
 $\
sum
_{
j
 =
 
1
}
^\
in
fty
 \
sum
_{
k
 =
 
1
}
^\
in
fty
 \
frac
{
1
}{
(
j
 +
 k
)^
3
}$
 in
 terms
 of
 $
p
$
 and
 $
q
$,
 we
 start
 by
 rewriting
 the
 given
 double
 sum
 in
 a
 more
 manageable
 form
.


First
,
 observe
 that
 the
 sum
 $\
sum
_{
j
 =
 
1
}
^\
in
fty
 \
frac
_{
k
 =
 
1
}
^\
in
fty
 \
frac
{
1
}{
(
j
 +
 k
)^
3
}$
 can
 be
 interpreted
 as
 sum
ming
 over
 all
 pairs
 $(
j
,
 k
)$
 in
 the
 first
 quadrant
,
 including
 the
 diagonal
.
 We
 can
 rewrite
 this
 by
 changing
 the
 order
 of
 summ
ation
:


$$


\
sum
_{
j
 =
 
1
}
^\
in
fty
 \
sum
_{
k
 =
 
1
}
^\
in
fty
 \
frac
{
1
}{
(
j
 +
 k
)^
3
}
 =
 


Notice
 that
 double
 summ
ation
 $\
sum
_{
j
,
 \
 k
,
 \
 j
+k
>
0
}\
frac
{
1
}{
(
j
+k
)^
3
}$
can
 be
 arranged
 as
 sum
ming
 
1
 on
 the
 diagonal
 or
 above
 and
 then
 mirrored
 below
 it
 (
since
 for
 $
j
+k
>
0
$,
 we
 have
 positive
 terms
).
 Hence
 we
 proceed
 by
 considering
 like
 terms
:


$$


\
begin
{

\
sum
_{
j
